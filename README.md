# Arts in Älta

Artsalta is a website for anyone interested and/or looking for an arts club located in Älta. This website is created to reach out and give users information about the club. 
The information provided by the page will tell the user all they need to know about what the club does, when they meet up, where they are located, how to sign up to join and contact the club. The Website also provides information that shows the user some of the work done by members through a gallery page with images from the event.

## User Stories

When creating and developing the design for the website these User Stories was taken under consideration:

### User Stories
* "I want to easily navigate through the website"
* "I want a simple and easy sign up form with relevent infromation"
* "I want to be able to read the whole site on my phone and/or tablet" 
* "I want clear information about time, meetings and where the club is located" 
* "I want links to relevent social media platforms" 
* "I want to see picture of work done by other members"

## UX 

The design of the website is minimalistic with a warm colours to create a sofisticated website that is clean and have focus on the shared and relevant information to the user. The design should lead the user through the website and make it easy for them to navigate. The design is based on the given User Stories and the goals that Arts in Älta have by launching a website.


### Layout 
The layout has a flow of sections on top of each other. These sections are divided in to two divisions next to each other. The only exception are the Quote Section and the Gallery Section. This layoutt makes it easy for the user to view the content and understand what each section is about.
When viewed on a smaller device the division gets an vertically layout, to make it easier for the viewer to read the content on the screen. See Wireframe Section for picture of the layout idea.

### Colour Scheme 

The colours chosen for the website are a burgndy-red #5c0b1d, a warm pink #b26f6c and a light pink #fff7f3 as background colour. I choese these because the go well with each other and make a good contrast when put togehter.

### Typography 

To keep the design of the website minimalistic with a fun twist I used a clean simple font for the overall text on the website, and for the Headings a more playful font. I importet two fonts from Google fonts: 
* [Monserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon)
* [Molle](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Molle?query=moll)

The social icons in the footer are imported from Fontawesome, they fonts used are: 
* [Facebook](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/facebook-square?style=brands)
* [Instagram](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/instagram?style=brands)
* [Spotify](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/spotify?style=brands)

## Technologies Used

The technologies used to develop this project are following: 
 
* HTML: HTML5 was used to create the core structure of the website.

* CSS: CSS was used to style all the pages on the website.

* GitHub: GitHub were used to store my repository and GitHub Pages was used to deployed the website. 

* GitPod: GitPod was used as the develpoment enviorment for developing my code during this project.

* Git: Git was used to ensure that the project would have backups and all the version pushed to GitHub during the development of ths project.

* Dev Tools: Dev Tools was used to look over the developent of the website and try different approches to problems that would occur during the process. 

* Unicorn Revealer: Unicorn Revealer was used to find bugs, especially during the process of making the website responsive.

* Auto Prefixer: Was used at the end of the project to give my CSS code some extra properties when used on different browsers.  

## Testing
Testing done for the website was done both manually and automatically. 

For manual testing I always had a tab open with the preview of the website. To check up on my code and see if worked as I wanted. During the development of the website, I used Dev Tools to see how the code would respond if I added or change properties or value to it. Dev Tools was also used to check for responsiveness when decreasing or increasing the screen size. 
Another tool used during development and testing was Unicorn Revealer, which helped me see if any content where being outside its container. 

To see and test the websites performance, I used Lighthouse, which gave me an updated report if to see how well my accessibility where for the website. This was used, together with Dev Tools when I needed to change and choose the colour of the website. The last test results where these: 

### Functions

I also tested all the implemented function to the website on three different browsers, these are the functions tested:

* #### The logo in the header
The logo on the left side of the header “Arts in Älta” is linked to the given landing page of the website. When selected it takes the user to the top of the Home page.

* #### The Navigation bar/ Menu 
When the user navigates through the menu it takes the user to the top of the assigned page. 

* #### Scroll function for When in the Navigation bar
When a user selects the When button in the menu, the index page will load first and then scroll smoothly down to the When section of the Home page. However, this application does not render well in with the Safari browser or when used on a mobile device. 

* #### Google Maps 
The embedded Google Map works well in all tested browser. The user can use the commandos for zooming, get direction to the place and open in a new tab if selected.

* #### The Sign Up
The form works in all browsers. It will only submit the given content if all required fields are written correctly. If not, it will give the user a notification on that specific field and ask them to write in the right form of information. 

* #### Social Media icons links
All three Social Media icons works well an all tested browsers. When selected each link open in a new tab for the content given to them.

### Browser Compatibility

* Chrome
  * The website works with well in Chrome and have full browser compatibility. The layout and all the functions that are applied to the website response as it should. All the pages load its content accordingly. 

* Firefox
  * The website works well in Firefox and have full browser compatibility. The layout and all the functions response as it should. All the pages load its content accordingly. 

* Safari 
  * The website works well in Safari. The layout and most of the function works as they should. Safari does not seem to render the Google font ‘Molle’ the way I have imported it or with the help of the Autoprefixer. The browser does not support the given scroll attribute given to the When button in the menu, but it takes you to the given destination on the website.

### Code Validation
For automatically testing the WC3 Validator and Jigsaw Validator was used on the code.

* HTML
 * The code have no form of errors but it has one warning, which is that the Quote section lacks a h-element, when passing through the offical [WC3-validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fstroemlind.github.io%2Fartsinalta%2Findex.html)

* CSS
 * No errors where found when passing through the offical [(Jigsaw)-validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fstroemlind.github.io%2Fartsinalta%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=svs)

### Responsiveness 

The website response to the flow when increasing or decreasing the screen size. The content flow in an order to make the layout and content easy to follow for the user when using different screen size. 
When the screen size decreases the layout re-arrange itself to go from a layout with a row look to a layout with a column look. This is to make the user experience more comfortable for the user. The content also re-size itself to fit the screen size and view. 
As can be seen bellow 

### Tested User Stories

### Unfixed Bugs 
There were two bug that I was not able to fix during this project

* The google font ‘Molle’ do not render on safari or internet mobile apps. A solution to this could be to download the font and upload it to the repository.

* The scroll function does not work on Safari or internet mobile apps. A solution to this could be that I have to fix the scroll element in the code with some extra values. 

* I am aware of the warning from the HTML Validator about the Quote Section.

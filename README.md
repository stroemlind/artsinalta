# Arts in Älta

Artsalta is a website for anyone interested and/or looking for an arts club located in Älta. This website is created to reach out and give users information about the club. 
The information provided by the page will tell the user all they need to know about what the club does, when they meet up, where they are located, how to sign up to join and contact the club. The Website also provides information that shows the user some of the work done by members through a gallery page with images from the event. 

Will add amiresponsive image here 

## UX 
The design of the website is minimalistic with a twist of colors to create a fun and energy giving experience to the user. The design should lead the user through the website and make it easy for them to navigate

### Colour Scheme 
The colours chosen for the website are orange, blue and a very light grey. I choose orange and blue because they are complimentary colours, which create a good contrast to each other.

### Typography 
To keep the design of the website minimalistic with a fun twist I used a clean simple font for the overall text on the website, and for the Headings a more playful font. I importet two fonts from Google fonts: 
* Monserrat 
* Molle 

The social icons in the footer are imported from Font-awesome, they fonts used are: 
* Facebook
* Instagram 
* Spotify 

### Wireframes

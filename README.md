# Arts in Älta

Artsalta is a website for anyone interested and/or looking for an arts club located in Älta. This website is created to reach out and give users information about the club. 
The information provided by the page will tell the user all they need to know about what the club does, when they meet up, where they are located, how to sign up to join and contact the club. The Website also provides information that shows the user some of the work done by members through a gallery page with images from the event. 

Will add amiresponsive image here 

## User Stories

* "I want clear information about time, meetings and where the club is located"

## UX 

The design of the website is minimalistic with a warm colours to create a sofisticated website that is clean and have focus on the shared and relevant information to the user. The design should lead the user through the website and make it easy for them to navigate.

### Colour Scheme 

The colours chosen for the website are a burgndy-red #5c0b1d, a warm pink #b26f6c and a light pink #fff7f3 as background colour. I choese these because the go well with each other and make a good contrast when put togehter.

### Typography 

To keep the design of the website minimalistic with a fun twist I used a clean simple font for the overall text on the website, and for the Headings a more playful font. I importet two fonts from Google fonts: 
* [Monserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon)
* [Molle](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Molle?query=moll)

The social icons in the footer are imported from Fontawesome, they fonts used are: 
* [Facebook](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/facebook-square?style=brands)
* [Instagram](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/instagram?style=brands)
* [Spotify](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/spotify?style=brands)
